## Submission Instructions

## Overview
The app I'm creating for my capstone project is called YourGov. It was born out of a desire to be able to interact with my local city officals but struggling to find out who to talk to. The app will use your GPS location or a stored address to search a database of information I will set up to locate a list of all their local officals and ways to easily contact them. I will utilize maps available online thru the various municipalities in St. Louis to plot out zones on google maps and then using the google maps api return a zone number based off the entered location. The Zone number would then ping against my database of information returning the user with a list of their local officals such as; city councilperson / alderman, local police chief, city street maintence contact, etc. After finding the correct person the app will provide ways to contact them, initially providing email/phone and later in app direct contact. As direct contact is added the ability to rate officals and their response times would be available for public view, almost like a profile on social media but for our city officals.

## Features
User Login: Ability to enter your name and address to have quicker access to your personalized list. Location based results using Google Maps API: Pre-plotted zones that link with a stored database of officials. Database of local officials: Compiled by hand due to various differences in website formating for officials. Rating system: Allows users who have contacted officials to be able to rate their conversations and the time it took them to respond.

## Technologies
-C#/.net 
-MySQL 
-Google Maps API 
-Java/Javascript 
-Html/CSS

## What I'll Have to Learn
I'll have to learn Javascript to be able to work with the google maps API, Java will most likely be a part of that. Plotting zones and integrating with Google Maps API will be important as well.
